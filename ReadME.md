🚀 **Adaptive Ethical Prism Framework (AEPF) - Open Source AI Ethics**  

Welcome to **AEPF_OpenSource**, a **community-driven framework** for ensuring AI systems operate transparently, ethically, and responsibly.  

## 🌍 Why AEPF?  
As AI becomes more autonomous, **ethical alignment is no longer optional—it’s essential**. AEPF is an **open-source standard** designed to:  
✔ **Assess AI decision-making fairness**  
✔ **Provide transparent ethical evaluations**  
✔ **Prevent AI systems from reinforcing biases or harm**  

Unlike corporate-led AI ethics initiatives, **AEPF is independent, global, and open to all**. No hidden agendas—just a framework built **for humanity, by humanity**.
